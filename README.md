# Parkinson_registry
Registry forms for Parkinson in Persian and English.This registry is provided by Vahid Nouri under supervision of Dr. Shariati.
Since this registry is working based on web2py, I uploaded just three files of controller, views and models in the firsy version which supports just Persian at the moment.
This file will be updated during developing the project.
