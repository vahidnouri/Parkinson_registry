# Parkinson_registry
Registry forms for Parkinson in Persian and English.This registry is provided by Vahid Nouri under supervision of Dr. Shariati.
Since this registry is working based on web2py, I uploaded just three files of controller, views and models in the first version which supports just Persian at the moment.
Since I want to add 1000 further fields, the form would be slow. So, I divide the form to several sections as follow:
reception_section
patient_section
physician_section
lab_section
and genes section which contains 10 sub groups of 100 genes with 10 variants for each gene.
